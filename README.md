# Frontend Mentor - Meet landing page solution

This is my attempt at the [Meet landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/meet-landing-page-rbTDS6OUR). The challenge concludes the 'building responsive layouts' learning path, which has given me a good reason to go back to the basics with HTML and CSS, while sharpening my knowledge on how to best create responsive solutions to work on all screen sizes and devices. For this specific challenge, I have seen the value in planning ahead and focusing on structuring the HTML efficiently to create a straightforward and logical implementation of the designs. Accessibility measures have also been taken from the very start of planning, ensuring a user friendly experience for all users.
